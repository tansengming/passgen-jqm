# Password Generator in jQuery Mobile

This is a tiny 1 pager that creates a unique password for your sites based on the site URL and a master password.

I built it when I needed a mobile version for [Nic Wolff's Password Generator](http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.html).

_This has been deprecated and has now been replaced by a [version made with Ratchet](https://github.com/tansengming/passgen)_
